# Task Manager App – Multi-User Boards with FastAPI, Firebase Auth, and Firestore

This cloud-based task management application allows users to collaborate on shared task boards with real-time updates, secure user authentication, and robust backend logic. It was developed using Python (FastAPI) for the backend, Firebase Authentication for login/logout, and Firestore as the NoSQL cloud database.

The project followed secure deployment practices by avoiding local service keys and interacting directly with Firestore using authorized API calls. It was evaluated in an academic environment and ran successfully without any additional configuration — earning a final score of **90%**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Login/Logout** via Firebase Authentication (JavaScript client)
- 🗂 **Task Boards**: Create and manage boards with nested tasks
- 👥 **Multi-User Collaboration**: Invite users to boards and assign tasks
- ✅ **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks
- 📅 **Task Metadata**: Tracks due dates, timestamps, and completion status
- 🧠 **Firestore Hierarchy**: 
  - Users → Boards → Tasks (no composite indexes required)
- 🧼 **Strict Permissions**:
  - Only board owners can rename or delete boards or remove users
  - Removed users no longer see the board and their tasks are unassigned
- 📊 **Dashboards**:
  - Counters for active, completed, and total tasks
  - Highlighting for unassigned tasks

## 🔐 Security

This project did **not** expose `service-account.json` or store sensitive credentials in the codebase. All interactions with Firestore were done securely through proper authentication.

## 🛠 Setup (for demonstration)

To run this locally (you’ll need your own Firebase project):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
